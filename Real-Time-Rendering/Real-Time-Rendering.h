 *
 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * A real-time software rendering library for C++, developed by Andrew Richardson
 *
 * \section install_sec Installation
 * 
 * Can be compiled from source using cmake
 * 
 * - define REALTIME_EXPORTS for dll building
 * - define STATICLIB for static lib
 * 
 * VS2017 solutions made with cmake can be found in cmakebuilds folder
 * you may need to add the resources folder and some of the dlls to working
 * directory to get these to compile though. A hand made solution is available
 * int he root directory of this project which may compile easier, though you may
 * need to switch the compiler version
 * 
 * \section About
 * 
 * This was a self-directed project for university, I am interested in rendering tech
 * and felt it would be worthwhile to learn how GPUs actually render objects. The functionality
 * is fairly limited for a renderer at this point.
 * 
 * \section Disclaimer
 * 
 * This project was created for a University project, it is my first large project
 * in C++. As such this is far from perfect C++ code and contains some bad practices
 * I became aware of during in development and likely some I am unware of.
 * 
 * Due to time constaints some of the code is a mess (ObjectParser is a good example) and 
 * needs cleaning up.
 * 
 * \section Usage
 * There is a little bit of setup up required but the general loop once set up is
 * simple. See BasicCube.cpp in Real-Time-Rendering demos for a working code example
 * with SDL controls
 * 
 * Setup:
 * - Load in a mesh using ObjectParser
 * - Instantiate a DefaultVertexShader
 * - Instantiate an implementer of RasterizerMode
 * - Instantiate an Object and pass it the Mesh, VertexShader and RasterizerMode
 * - If you have a texture load it with SDL_image and assign it to the object
 * - Create an SDL_Surface to act as the frame buffer
 * - Instantiate a camera
 * - Instantiate a device and pass it the camera and sercice
 * - Instantiate a pipeline with a view mode and the device
 * - If you want to use RenderThreaded set the threadlimit of pipeline 
 *  default is 4
 * 
 * Render an object:
 * - Call pipeline::Render() or pipeline::RenderThreaded() with the object
 *
 * \section Other Libraries and their licenses
 * 
 * The library itself has a very small dependency on SDL2 that I hope to remove to
 * lower the dependcy count. GLM is used for most of methematics.
 * 
 * The demo uses SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL_ttf, libpng, zlib, libfreetype
 * 
 * Licences:

 * Introduction
 * ============
 *
 *  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
 *  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
 *  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
 *  FreeType Project.
 *
 *  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
 *  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
 *  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
 *  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
 *
 *  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
 *  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
 *  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
 *  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:
 *
 *    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
 *      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)
 *
 *    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
 *      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)
 *
 *    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
 *      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
 *      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
 *      FreeType code. (`credits')
 *
 *  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
 *  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
 *  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
 *  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.
 *
 *
 *  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
 *  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
 *  encourage you to use the following text:
 *
 *   """
 *    Portions of this software are copyright Â© <year> The FreeType
 *    Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
 *   """
 *
 *  Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
 *  actually use.
 *
 *
 * Legal Terms
 * ===========
 *

 * --------------
 *
 *  Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
 *  and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally

 *  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
 *  beta or final release.
 *
 *  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
 *   `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
 *   code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
 *   This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
 *   engine'.

 *   original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
 *   If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
 *   this license, you must contact us to verify this.
