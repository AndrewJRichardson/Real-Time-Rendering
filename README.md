# Real-Time 3D software rendering library for C++
## About this project 
This is my final year project for University. I chose to make a rendering library as I have always had an interest in games and wanted to learn about how the graphics engines eork underneath. While software renderers are rarely used these days I felt that I would gain more knowledge and a better understanding of rendering by programming the functionality that API's and GPU's offer.  
## Extra information about this project 
This was my first big project in C++ (we were taught Java and were required to complete most of out projects in it) and as such this project will have some code in it that contains bad practices and C++ specific errors. Some of which I am aware of (but learnt about too late in development to fix), and likely many of which I am unaware of. While I could fix some of these now, I prefer to leave the project in the state is was in when it was handed in. The same goes for the mathematics involved; there are some mistakes I am aware of and likely several I am not. Due to time constaints some of the code is a mess (ObjectParser is a good example) and needs cleaning up.

There is some very barebones documentation available in the documentation folder.
